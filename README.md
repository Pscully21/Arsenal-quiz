## Description

For this module we were asked to create a Quiz page that could quiz anyone on anything! I chose to create a quiz based on my favorite soccer club Arsenal FC! I did create one JavaScript question at the very end also. This homework helped us utilize local storage and applying that on a front-end basis. Keeping track of the high-score along with calling the correct code in certain parts of the HTML is a vital part in becoming a full-stack web developer. Constantly using technologies like these and improving on them will prove to be benefitial in creating a long-term successful carreer in coding!
